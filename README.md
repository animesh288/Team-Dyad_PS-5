### Problem Statement : Miscellaneous 5

## Objective: 
To create an informative AI-based tool that should be able to give alerts and identify cases of mental health issues in children and also track the improvement status in identified cases. It should be able to track mental health issues prevalent in children from birth to the ones which they acquired later in their life for remediation and counselling. The tool should support teacher’s assessment as well as parental and self-assessment.

## Why this problem statement:
Our team has chosen this problem statement because, we ourselves being students, are very well aware of the state of mental health of us students and also how this pandemic has added to worsening it further for more and more people. And therefore we decided to first-handedly come up with a solution to the most common problem of most of the students these days and help them combat it quicker and in a much easier way.

## Why did we choose the name ‘ME&ME’:
In our attempt at helping students to better their mental health, we wanted a name that helped us in the process and came up with ‘ME&ME’. The name emphasises the need for the student to prioritise themselves for some time and work for their own betterment.

## Our approach to solve the problem:
In our attempt at solving the issue of poor mental health in students in the present times, we have tried to make an application that is user friendly and personalised, i.e., it works differently for people with different issues. Here, we check all the conditions of the student before advising or assigning any tasks, to make sure that the task,for the particular student, is do-able and won’t have any worse effect on the student’s mental or physical health.

<br>
The application provides the user with three different portals :
<br>
1. THE TASKS : For viewing the daily tasks,which are assigned to the user based on their past records, daily habits and health conditions.
This is governed by the four major parameters that we calculate from the large data input.

2. DAILY ANALYSIS : For tracking daily progress and all the tasks of the previous day, Here the user is required to give a questionnaire related to their present conditions and then check all the tasks that they have completed in the previous day.

3. PROGRESS TRACKING : Last of the profile which shows the graph of how the past days of the student have been, making it easier to understand where the problem lies and where much improvement is required.
<br>
In our app we’ve also given parents and teachers a login feature, where they can access their ward’s profile to check their progress and confirm whether the ward is actually doing the tasks seriously or not. Which helps at increasing the accuracy of the application at tracking the user’s progress and also makes the task assigning feature more realistic.

### Colour Scheme:
Purple is the main colour used in the colour scheme.The colour is associated
with wisdom and spirituality. The rarity and mystery of it may make it seem
linked to the unknown, supernatural, and divine. Purple shades represent
different spiritual meanings. Generally, light purples represent light-hearted
energies, while darker shades may represent sadness or frustration.
We chose purple to be the main colour of the colour scheme because of the
vibes and the energies associated with the colour, which will help the users
further in their journey of combating ill mental health.

### About the Logo:
The logo of the application is designed in such a manner, that it comforts the user, and
signifies how the application aims at taking care of the whole of an individual. And it tells the
user how they have to bring their heart and brain together and wisely make the right
decisions for their body and soul.
